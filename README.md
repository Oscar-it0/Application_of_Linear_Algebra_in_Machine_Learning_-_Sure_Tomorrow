# Sprint 13 - Project: Application of Linear Algebra in Machine Learning - Sure Tomorrow

The project applies the knowledge acquired in a practical context to linear algebra in the world of machine learning.

---

## Project Objective

The insurance company **Sure Tomorrow** seeks to apply machine learning techniques to solve problems related to its customers. The task is to evaluate the feasibility of these solutions and develop models that address different challenges.

---

## Project Tasks

1. **Similar customers**  
   Find customers similar to a given one to improve marketing strategies.

2. **Benefit prediction**  
   Determine whether a new customer is likely to receive insurance benefits. Compare the performance of a trained model with a dummy model.

3. **Benefit regression**  
   Predict the amount of benefits a customer could receive using linear regression.

4. **Personal data protection**  
   Develop a data masking algorithm that protects personal information without affecting model quality.

## Dataset

The data is contained in three CSV files:

- `insurance_us.csv`

File content:

- 'Gender'
- 'Age'
- 'Salary'
- 'Family members'
- 'Insurance benefits'
