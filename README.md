## Project Tasks

1. Find customers similar to a given one to improve marketing strategies.
2. Determine whether a new customer is likely to receive insurance benefits. Compare the performance of a trained model with a dummy model.
3. Predict the amount of benefits a customer could receive using linear regression.
4. Develop a data masking algorithm that protects personal information without affecting model quality.
